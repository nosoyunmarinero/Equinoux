## 🐳 Docker Configuration

The backend uses a custom Dockerfile optimized for running Chromium in a containerized environment:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim

# Install Chromium and dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    chromium \
    fonts-liberation \
    libnss3 \
    libgbm1 \
    # ... (35+ system dependencies)
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Environment variables for Chromium
ENV CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium
ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
ENV PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium

# Application setup
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

**Key Configuration:**
- **No-sandbox mode**: Required for containerized environments
- **Shared memory optimization**: `--disable-dev-shm-usage` flag
- **Headless operation**: All browsers run without GUI

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Frontend (GitHub Pages)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to gh-pages branch
npm run deploy
```

### Backend (Google Cloud Run)

```bash
cd backend

# Build and push container
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/equinoux-backend/backend .

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy backend \
  --image gcr.io/equinoux-backend/backend \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 2Gi \
  --cpu 2 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --min-instances 0 \
  --max-instances 10 \
  --concurrency 5
```

**Why these settings?**
- **2Gi memory**: Chromium requires significant RAM
- **2 CPUs**: Improves analysis performance
- **300s timeout**: Some websites take time to load
- **min-instances 0**: Scales to zero when unused (cost-effective)
- **max-instances 10**: Handles traffic spikes

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Equinoux embraces the **Frutiger Dark** aesthetic—a design trend that combines:
- **Glossy surfaces** and **depth** through gradients and shadows
- **Vibrant colors** with purpose (blues, purples, teals)
- **Playful elements** like the music player
- **Functional beauty** that doesn't sacrifice usability

**Why not flat minimalism?**  
While flat design has its place, Equinoux proves that tools can be both functional *and* delightful. The glossy, dimensional UI creates an engaging experience that makes website testing feel less like a chore and more like an exploration.

## 🎵 Music Player Features

The integrated music player adds personality to the analysis experience:

- **Curated Playlist**: Carefully selected background tracks
- **Random Playback**: Different song on each visit
- **Full Controls**: Play, pause, next, previous
- **Seek Functionality**: Click anywhere on the progress bar
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated play/pause states
- **Non-intrusive**: Complements the analysis workflow

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No data storage**: URLs and results are never stored
- **CORS protection**: Only whitelisted origins can access the API
- **HTTPS enforced**: All production traffic is encrypted
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse (handled by Cloud Run)
- **Sandboxed execution**: Chrome runs in isolated containers

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Frontend
- **Hosting**: $0 (GitHub Pages)
- **SSL**: $0 (Included)
- **CDN**: $0 (GitHub's infrastructure)

### Backend
- **Container Storage**: ~$0.05/month (GCR)
- **Compute**: Pay-per-use
  - 100 analyses/month: ~$0.20
  - 1,000 analyses/month: ~$2.00
  - 10,000 analyses/month: ~$15.00
- **Idle cost**: $0.00 (scales to zero)

**Total Monthly Cost (low usage)**: < $1

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"ECONNREFUSED" error:**
- Ensure Chromium is properly installed in the container
- Verify Chrome flags include `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox`

**"Frame was detached" error:**
- Increase memory allocation (min 2Gi recommended)
- Check timeout settings
- Verify the target website is accessible

**Cold start delays:**
- First request after idle period takes 3-5 seconds
- Consider setting `--min-instances 1` for instant responses (adds cost)

### Frontend Issues

**CORS errors:**
- Verify backend URL in frontend code
- Check CORS configuration in `app.js`
- Ensure domain is whitelisted

**Music player not loading:**
- Check audio file paths in `/assets`
- Verify files are included in build
